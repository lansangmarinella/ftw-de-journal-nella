## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned that clearly defining the problem first is really important before jumping into solutions.
- In framing business question, it is important to consider the questions that "make money", "save money", and "compliance".
- Data quality is not only about accuracy but it's all about its five dimensions: accuracy, completeness, reliability, relevancy, and timeliness.
- Data trust is built through a combination of accuracy, transparency, and timeliness.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Data Quality Contract: Defines thresholds, frequency, and ownership of data quality checks.
- MTTD (Mean Time To Detect): How fast a data issue is identified.
- MTTR (Mean Time To Resolve): How long it takes to fix a data issue after detection.
- Referential Integrity: Ensuring all foreign keys correctly reference primary keys in related tables.
- SLA (Service Level Agreement): Helps ensure accountability and reliability across systems.

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- In Data Engineering, data is not meant to be understandable to others, but it must be "efficient".
- In data warehouse: Data must be "RAW" and must be unedited. If you need to edit something on a specific column, it is advisable to simply add another column.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)

- I’m still trying to fully understand Third Normal Form (3NF) and how to apply it properly in real datasets.

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)

- [ ] Review examples of tables normalized to 3NF to fully undertstand it.
- [ ] Try building my own DQ dashboard in Metabase.
- [ ] Practice more writing DQ queries in SQL before moving to dbt.
- [ ] Simplifying my explanations so they make sense even to non-technical people.

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

- My previous group repo(Oulad): https://github.com/EzekielleGambong/ftw--bootcamp-grp4/tree/main/Activities/Oulad
- Our group dashboard (Oulad): https://ftw.dataengineering.ph/dashboard/44-oulad-group4

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)

- Gradually, our assignments made things click for me. I can now picture how the whole pipeline works from scratch.
It is also important to remember that it’s not just about cleaning and moving data around.
It’s about making sure the data stays good as it flows through the pipeline.
