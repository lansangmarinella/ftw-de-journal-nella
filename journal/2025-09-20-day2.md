## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Testing and validation are essential to build trust in data.
- Dimensional modeling helps organize data for easier analysis.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- Dimensional modeling: structuring data into facts and dimensions for analysis.

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and querying aren’t optional.
It is essential since they’re what make the data accurate and reliable.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)


## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- I’m still not confident in building a pipeline on my own, and I often get mixed up with the steps along the way.

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- I realized that I still need more practice in doing our assignment on my own. 
During group work, I still rely on my teammates, but I want to build more confidence by practicing independently. 
By working on small examples, I believe I can improve my skills and understand the process better. 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
It is essential to always check the rows, sums, and outliers at every stage. 
As a group, we need to make sure our pipeline leads to one clear and consistent source of truth.
