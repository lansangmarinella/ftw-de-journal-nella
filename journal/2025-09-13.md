## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- I learned the difference between ETL and ELT. 
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) applies transformations before loading, while ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)stores raw data first and performs transformations afterward. 
- ELT is more widely adopted today because raw data can be re-processed whenever business rules or requirements change.
- The Data Load Tool (dlt) streamlines the process of extracting data from multiple sources.
- A three-stage pipeline (Raw → Clean → Mart) establishes traceability and ensures data reliability.
- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) is designed for real-time transactions, whereas OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) is focused on analytics.
- Row-oriented database is optimized for fast inserts and updates, while Column-oriented database is more efficient for reads and aggregations.
- SQL “Big 6”: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY.
- Sandbox Database provides a safe environment for testing and experimentation, separate from production systems.
- Metabase is a visualization tool that connects to marts to present analytical insights.
- 6 V’s of Big Data: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, Variability, Value.

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): clean/shape data before storing.
- ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): store raw data first, then clean when needed.
- DLT (Data Load Tool): Python library for loading messy data into structured formats.
- OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): good for historical analysis.
- OLT (Online Transactional Processing): good for real-time business transactions.
- CTAS (Create Table As Select): A SQL command to create new tables from query results.
- DBT (Data Build Tool): Tool for SQL-based transformations and data modeling.

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Keep raw data intact for auditing.
- Standard Raw → Clean → Mart process ensures consistent results.
- Use Sandbox Database for trial runs before production.

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- Cleaned missing values in horsepower since clean data = better analysis.
- Using a Sandbox Database for trial runs, as it provides a safe environment for testing. 
The trade-off is that it requires extra setup, but it minimizes risks of errors affecting live data.
- Tried to run queries directly in Metabase rather than connecting through DBeaver, since it allowed quicker visualization. 
The trade-off is that Metabase is less robust for detailed SQL management compared to DBeaver.

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
- I am still uncertain about how to set up a full data pipeline on my own without using my notes as a guide.

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- Practice writing more SQL queries
- Build own Raw → Clean → Mart pipeline
- Explore more the Metabase
- Review the prerequisite courses on DataCamp that are required for the assignments.

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- CREATE TABLE:
CREATE TABLE sandbox.mpg_vs_hp
engine = Memory
AS
SELECT
mpg,horsepower
from clean.mpg_standardized;

- DROP TABLE: DROP TABLE sandbox.mpg_vs_hp;

- SELECT name, mpg, horsepower
FROM raw.autompg___cars
WHERE cylinders = '8'
ORDER BY mpg DESC;

- CREATE TABLE sandbox.mpg_vs_hp
engine = Memory 
AS SELECT mpg, horsepower
FROM clean.mpg_standardized;

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
- ELT offers greater flexibility by allowing raw data to be reused. 
- The Raw → Clean → Mart process highlighted the importance of data quality, as poor data leads to analyzation. 
- Using DBeaver and Metabase showed me how pipelines connect coding to business insights.
- The Sandbox Database plays a critical role by isolating experimental work from production. 
It enables safe testing, validation, and iteration of queries or models while preserving the integrity and stability of operational data systems.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
